The [**Violence & Impacts Early Warning System (VIEWS)**](https://viewsforecasting.org/) is an award-winning conflict prediction system that generates monthly forecasts for violent conflicts across the world up to three years in advance, at both country and sub-country levels of analysis. The views-platform contains several repositories, individual packages and documentation that encapsulates the entire process of developing, experimenting, training, evaluating, and deploying the VIEWS machine learning model pipeline.

Use our [interactive data dashboard](https://data.viewsforecasting.org/) to explore our latest predictions of future armed conflict.

> [!CAUTION]
> Please note that this pipeline is **actively under construction**. We're in the **process of development**, meaning it's **not yet ready for operational use**. We're working hard to bring you a robust and fully-functional tool, so stay tuned for updates!

### Pipeline Overview

The VIEWS machine learning pipeline involves several key processes:

- **Developing:** Creating and refining machine learning models.
- **Experimentation:** Testing and validating various model configurations and approaches.
- **Training:** Training models with relevant data.
- **Evaluating:** Assessing model performance and accuracy.
- **Deploying:** Implementing models in a production environment to generate monthly true-future forecasts. 


## About the VIEWS Project

The VIEWS project is a collaborative effort supported by leading research institutions focused on peace and conflict studies. For more information about the project, visit the [VIEWS Forecasting webpage](https://viewsforecasting.org/).

### Affiliations

- **Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO):**
  The [Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO)](https://www.prio.org/) conducts research on the conditions for peaceful relations between states, groups, and people. PRIO is dedicated to understanding the processes that lead to violence and those that create sustainable peace. About half of the VIEWS core team is currently located at PRIO.

- **Department of Peace and Conflict Research at the University of Uppsala:**
  The [Department of Peace and Conflict Research at Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/en/department/peace-and-conflict-research) is a leading academic institution in the study of conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and security. The department is renowned for its research and education programs aimed at fostering a deeper understanding of conflict dynamics and peace processes. This department also hosts the [Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP)](https://ucdp.uu.se/), a central data source for the VIEWS project. About half of the VIEWS core team is currently located at Uppsala University .
